                    <p>Image of my choice is very interesting. It shows my beautiful motorcycle in details. The viewer can see the parts very closely. Also the image is full of cranberry red. This is a very bright color and it can be included into the color scheme of the design. I am the rider and I decided to wear a shirt of similar color to support the color scheme.</p>

                    </figure>
    
                    <p>I always wanted to get a motorcycle like this one. Since I was 15 I watched some British or American movies and I would notice that if the need a motorcycle in their movie it will be always a Triumph. I felt in love with this modern classic type of motorcycles and Scrambler became my dream bike. This photograph tells that my dreams are achievable if I hold on tight to them.

                    <p>Michelle picked one image from one of her hikes. I really like her choice. On the one hand, the photograph is simple and shows one object. On the other hand, this photo has amazing colors and for different people can bring particular feelings. 
                    </p>
    
                    <p>Bouquet of bright, yellow and young sunflowers in hand against the sky has many different meanings. I think the original idea was to portray the “sun” in the sky exchanging the sun with the flowers which are named after the sun. This is very symbolic. However, may be this photograph has some deeper themes that stand behind…

                    <p>There are pictures which hold a story in them and it is important to teach close reading and
                        visual thinking skills to understand this story better.
                    </p>
                    <p>One of the ways to be detective. Careful attention to detail rewards the viewer with a “big
                        picture” understanding. Notice the details!
                    </p>

                    <p>The best way to learn something is to do it regularly. Practice regularly on explaining to
                        yourself “What’s Going On?” this picture, to help you practice close reading.
                    </p>
                    <p>Research other ideas and opinions. What do you think about observations made by anyone else?
                        Answering this question will help you evaluate and link to other ideas.
                    </p>
                    <p>After asking yourself “What’s Going On?” this picture start asking more detail oriented and try
                        to prove your conclusion by finding more evidence.
                    </p>
                    <p>When many questions rise the answers should appear too. This is called conversation and it is
                        important while learning close reading. Start conversations regarding particular photographs.
                    </p>
                    <p>After discussing about the photograph learn the real story that stands behind this work. Ask
                        photographers about what they were thinking when they took the shot.
                    </p>
                    <p>There are many other ways of learning visual literacy. Feel free to study them all.

                    <h2>of Overlays</h2>
                    <h3>How to Avoid Misusing Lightboxes...</h3>
                    <h4>October 20, 2021</h4>
                </div>
                <div class="section">
                    <p>
                        Overlays helps to quickly bring new information without losing the contents of the current
                        screen. The most popular intensions of an overlay is to view content, complete a form, or make a
                        decision.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The most important rules when creating overlays are: provide visible “close”; make it distinct
                        from background; make the overlay keyboard friendly; avoid scrolling and links inside the
                        overlay.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        To make a perfect overlay, designer has to answer 5 questions:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Who is the audience?</strong> Consider the possible resolutions of all users
                            devices. A large overlay on mobile can cause a need to zoom out which disorients the user.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>What actions users has to take?</strong> Designer should make it simple and quick
                            for the user to process the information on an overlay. This will become possible after
                            designer will exactly see what users have to do on the page. For example, if a user will
                            have to complete a form in the overlay, the designer should add a cancel button and save the
                            inputs in case of accidental canceling.</li>
                        <li> <strong>When an overlay will appear?</strong> Be careful with the overlays that are not
                            user-initiated. It can really annoy them. Make those in the right time. For example, when
                            the user leaves.</li>
                        <li><strong>Where it will appear?</strong> Try to position your overlay nearer to the top of the
                            page.</li>
                        <li><strong>Why it is not a page?</strong> Prefer an overlay instead of a page only if the user
                            has to take an action with serious consequences, it’s needed to collect a small amount of
                            info, the content in the overlay is urgent.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                    Plan your overlays appropriately.

                        First impressions last forever! This is an important principle for a modern web-site which
                        has a
                        mission to convert. One of the most important components of a successful design are forms.
                        Here
                        I
                        described the best practices for form design.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The amount of input fields does not have to overwhelm the user: try to separate into series
                        of
                        input
                        fields and do not forget to display the progress. Do not expect that the user will enter a
                        valid
                        input: it is a good practice to indicate the requirement for a valid input right away. Keep
                        the
                        labels close to the input field and determine the best position based on the screen size.
                        Very
                        first
                        input field should be active and highlighted so the user do not make a redundant click. In
                        addition,
                        test your input fields for their “Tab” key friendliness. Different buttons should differ and
                        have
                        enough space between each other. Their label has to continue the sentence “I want to…”.
                        People
                        like
                        to know their results, so always return a feedback even if the form is submitted
                        successfully.
                        Remember, “Reset” button will only make it worse…
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Lately, I fill out a lot of forms by applying for jobs. Usually the forms are long and
                        overwhelming,
                        but some of them are really nicely designed forms. One of these job applications is Facebook
                        application form. One of the best parts is that the amount of input fields is less than
                        other
                        companies have. I also can track my progress looking at the left progress bar. I like that
                        they
                        use
                        autocomplete input fields because it helps me to find a value quickly and I do not have to
                        type
                        it
                        all. There are so many other good design ideas implemented which you can check by applying
                        on
                        your
