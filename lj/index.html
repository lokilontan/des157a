                        First impressions last forever! This is an important principle for a modern web-site which has a
                        mission to convert. One of the most important components of a successful design are forms. Here
                        I
                        described the best practices for form design.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The amount of input fields does not have to overwhelm the user: try to separate into series of
                        input
                        fields and do not forget to display the progress. Do not expect that the user will enter a valid
                        input: it is a good practice to indicate the requirement for a valid input right away. Keep the
                        labels close to the input field and determine the best position based on the screen size. Very
                        first
                        input field should be active and highlighted so the user do not make a redundant click. In
                        addition,
                        test your input fields for their “Tab” key friendliness. Different buttons should differ and
                        have
                        enough space between each other. Their label has to continue the sentence “I want to…”. People
                        like
                        to know their results, so always return a feedback even if the form is submitted successfully.
                        Remember, “Reset” button will only make it worse…

                        Lately, I fill out a lot of forms by applying for jobs. Usually the forms are long and
                        overwhelming,
                        but some of them are really nicely designed forms. One of these job applications is Facebook
                        application form. One of the best parts is that the amount of input fields is smaller than other
                        companies have. I also can track my progress looking at the right progress bar. I like that they
                        use
                        autocomplete input fields because it helps me to find a value quickly and I do not have to type
                        it
                        all. There are so many other good design ideas implemented which you can check by applying on
                        your
