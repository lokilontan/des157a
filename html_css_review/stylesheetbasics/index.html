        <h1>CSS Basics</h1>

        <p>Please always follow these best practices when working with CSS</p>

        <h2>Linking Files</h2>
        <p>Always add files in this order: the normalize.css link first, any google fonts second and the link to your
            styles LAST. The normalize.css is a best practice to keep styles consistent across different browsers.</p>

        <p>You can get fonts from lots of places, but for this course, please just stick to Google fonts unless you have
            a really good reason not to do so. (Please run by me)</p>

        <p>Your stylesheet should always load last so that you can override styles from any other stylesheet that is
            included. Note that if you spel 'rel' or 'stylesheet' wrong, the styles wil not load. (Fairly common
            mistake).</p>

        <p style="color: red;">This paragraph has an inline style. Never do this. It is hard to maintain and it mucks up
            your HTML. Put all style rules in an external, linked, stylesheet. Always.</p>

        <h2>IDs and Classes</h2>

        <p id="onlyonce">This is super important: IDs are unique and can only be used once on a page. Classes can be
            used multiple times. This paragraph has an ID and can be targeted with a rule that starts with a # sign,
            like this: #onlyonce. IDs should be used sparingly, and are either for large sections of a page, or for
            unique items, like a specific button that you will need to target specifically.</p>

        <p class="multipletimes">This paragraph has a class attribute. Classe are for groups of things and can be used
            on the page multiple times. They are not as specific as IDs, but can be useful. You would target this
            paragraph with a rule that starts with a period, like this: .multipletimes</p>

        <h2>Keep your CSS as Lean and Mean as Possible</h2>

        <p>Use tags without any classes and IDs as much as possible. Write compound rules to get to elements inside,
            instead of adding unique IDs to all the elements. A rule with a selector like <strong>#mainsection
                p:first-of-type</strong> will target the first paragraph inside the element with ID mainsection. No need
            to add an ID to the paragraph. It takes practice to write lean CSS, but always strive for it!</p>

        <h2>Additional Tips for Organizing CSS</h2>

        <p>Keep general full page rules at the top of the CSS file, and add more specific rules for sections of your
            webpage further down the file. I usually have the rule for body tag first, where settings such as the
            font-family can be inherited by all the other elements on the page.</p>

        <p>Often I will create a little reset rule that removes padding and margin from specific elements, so I am not
            fighting the margin and padding built in by default to most browsers. See the attached stylesheet for
            examples.</p>
