                <p>My final project will deliver a better implementation of my Every Picture project.
                </p>

                </figure>
                <p>First project for comparison is FlyPlatoon. This website successfuly delivers its product. The main
                    interaction with the website is that it reacts on scroll. A user is able to scroll the page and
                    receive different information about the product provided by the company.</p>

                <p>They show their planes applying different lighing sources and angles. The surface of the planes is
                    very shiny. I'm guessing they use 3D graphics to display the model of the airplane. Sometimes there
                    is just high quality photographs with bright and sharp color.
                </p>

                <p>Looks very similar to what we are building in my Computer Graphics class. The experience using the
                    FlyPlatoon website is positive and clearly tells me about the services offered by the company.

                <p>Dima Kutsenko is a fashion photographer based in Ukraine. His website-portfolio creates really
                    outstanding visual representation of his art. As my Every Picture project he gives an opportunnity
                    to interact with his photographs by hovering them.
                </p>
                <p>He applies something similar to negative effect for his hovered photos. Website has interesting
                    interface. User can explore it in a very interesting way. Each transition to a different state or
                    link of his site can be done by clicking.
                </p>
                <p>I really appreciate the dependency of the oimages locations on the mouse position. I would like to
                    include this in my project. This web-site clearly indicates the intensions of the artist.
                </p>
                <span class="first">Project Goals</span>
                <p>I want to improve my Every Picture project and to add some new features which would help me to
                    deliver the information about the motorcycle in a more clear and creative way.
                </p>
                <p>My Final project will use the same effect as FlyPlatoon which is showing and explaining different
                    aspects of the airplanes. It will do that by letting the user hover and click on these details. Dima
                    Kutsenko does something simillar in his portfolio web-site.
                </p>
                <span class="first">Design Strategies</span>
                <p>I am going to use the same picture for the final and I want to add some appearing text and to dim the photograph while this text is displayed. So, this text will be on focus and it is also will be changing word by word. The words will somehow describe the main subject which is mototrcycle.</p> 
                <p>On click or after all text is displayed the dimmed picture will be displayed bright as usually. I will also have some kind of buttons for additional info which will display what is the project about and info about the motorcycle. 
                </p>
                </p>
                <span class="first">Interaction Strategies</span>
                <p>As one of my teammates suggested I should let the user know where are the potential regions that could be covered and information can be received. This can be solved by running a timer which will display the hints for each region. This can be also done on mouse move event.
                </p>
                <p>In addition, there can be added a moving info logo which on hover or click will uncover the regions. Clicking at the region a user will be able to see information about a part.</p>
                <span class="first">Experience Goals</span>
                <p>
                I want the target audiencce who are going to be my classmates, teacher, teaching assistance and potential buyers to learn more about the motorcycle and enjoy the nice picture of it.</p> 
                <p>To do this I will have to experiment with what's being said in this "brief" project description and finally implement it.
