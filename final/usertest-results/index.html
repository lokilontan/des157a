            <section id="content">
                <span class="first">Session Summary</span>
                <p>During the User Test session I was coupled with 3 other persons and each person within a pair gave each other a feedback.</p> 
                <p>3 other classmates are Gennifer, Julia and Louis and they were not the members form my usual group in order we get and give more objective feedback and what is more important feedback after seeing the first time a particular project.
                </p>

                <span class="first">Significant Observation 1</span>
                <p>I think first significant observation would be the one that no one from the testers noticed the supporting question icon button after the page is initially loaded. </p>

                    <p>I tried to make it noticeable by giving it some motion, but apparently the bike is more attractive so they just look at it and eventually start moving the mouse and discover the highlighting zones. Here is Gennifer Hom during the testing: </p> 
                
                <figure>
                    <img src="images/gen.jpeg" alt="Gennifer Hom">
                    <figcaption>Fig.1 - Gennifer Hom</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>Glenda advised to add an overlay when the slide show of text ends. The overlay would explain how the user should interact to get the best experience. She also mentioned that the moving question button does not add but oppositely removes the degree of aesthetics built with the other elements. I still think what I want to do exactly.</p>

                
                <span class="first">Significant Observation 2</span>
                
                <p>Some other improvements that could be made were mentioned by Julia and Louis. Julia suggested to leave the red hint dots if the question logo button is active. It will give more flexibility while trying to help user to determine the potential informational zones. Here is Julia looking for my bugs:

                    <figcaption>Fig.2 - Julia</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>Louis gave me a suggestion which we already talked about within my group. He said it would be nice to add an X icon to be able to close an informational overlay. It can be added easily. I should definitely do it.
                </p>
                
                <span class="first">Significant Observation 3</span>
                <p>Overall, all testers had the same set of features and design elements they liked. For example, it is first of all the element that greets the user. The idea with interchanging text was good. Here you can see Louis enjoying some of the elements of the bike:</p>
                <figure>
                    <img src="images/louis.jpeg" alt="louis">
                    <figcaption>Fig.3 - Louis</figcaption>
                </figure>    
                <p>Moreover, all testers liked the zooming in and out part. It adds more engagement to the overall experience. Julia also mentioned that the dimming after zooming in helps to focus on the part described.</p>
